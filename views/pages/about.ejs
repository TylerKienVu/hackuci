                &emsp;&emsp;On February 2-4 of 2018, participants from all over California came
                together to hack at University of California - Irvine's 'HackUCI'.
                Students from California State University of Fullerton,
                University of California San Diego, Univesity of California - Riverside,
                and University of Calilfornia - Irvine,
                all came to experience this wonderful event.&emsp;
                <br>
                <br>
                &emsp;&emsp;Juleanne Palad, Gevork Gabrielyan, Tyler Vu, Andrew Gomez, and Deone Peng (left to right),
                joined together to create a web application called
                'Guess that Hashtag'. The game is similar to 'Four Pics One Word', where the user
                figures out one word all the pictures have in common. In 'Guess that Hashtag',
                the user must figure out what hashtag all the tweets have in common. Gevork & Tyler constructed the back-end of the website by utilizing Node.js and the Twitter API while Andrew, Deone, & Juleanne
                designed the game's front-end using HTML & CSS.
